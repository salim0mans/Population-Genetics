In Impute5 directory, there are 3 tools:
  -Impute5_Chunker
  -Impute5_Converter
  -Impute5

Imputation requires the following steps by order:
1-Chunking the files: each chromosome is divided into a small set of chunks (overlapping in the buffer
regions).
2-Converting the reference to .imp5
3-Imputation of each chunk of data: running IMPUTE5 to impute each chunk of data independently
4-Ligation: ligate each chunk of imputed data together in order to create one file per chromosome.
To perform this, it is possible to use bcftools concat program.

From the inside of Impute5 directory:
^^^^^1-Chunking:

>for CHR in {20,22}; do ./imp5Chunker_1.1.5_static --h reference.vcf.gz --g target.vcf.gz --r ${CHR} --o coordinates.txt; done

#the output is a text file containing chunk info

^^^^^2-Converting the ref:

>for CHR in {20,22}; do ./imp5Converter_1.1.5_static --h reference.vcf.gz --r 20 --o reference.imp5; done

#this results in a ref file in imp5 format with corresponding index (.idx file)

######Note that converting works both ways

^^^^^3-Imputation:
#requires ref / input data / recombination genetic map / specify target region (chr) / output

#Genetic maps are downloaded from this rep: https://github.com/odela

>for CHR in {20,22}; do ./impute5_1.1.5_static --h chr${CHR}.p3.v5b.hg19.imp5 --m chr${CHR}.b37.gmap.gz --g target.vcf.gz --r 20:2000000-7000000 --o ${CHR}_imputed.vcf.gz

^^^^^4-Ligation:
I'm not sure If I need this for now.
